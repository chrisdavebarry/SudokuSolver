- I approached this problem from many different ways (rewrote the code from scratch like four times), but the final product I approached it somewhat like the N queens example at first but then realized after some discussion with my professor that it was similar but not the same. So I had to think about it much differently than I originally anticipated but it ended up working out with some help from my professor and refreshing myself on recursion.
